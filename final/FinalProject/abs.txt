NAME: Scissor kicks -- DESCRIPTION: Lie on your back with your legs straight up toward the ceiling. Let your arms rest down at your sides. You can also place your hands under your butt for increased stabilization. Squeeze your core and lower both of your legs 6-12 inches down to about a 45-degree angle. Lift one leg up as your lower the other toward the floor. Switch legs. Continue to alternate, moving your legs in a flutter motion.|
NAME: Side reaches -- DESCRIPTION: This move works your lower core muscles. Stand with your feet hips-distance apart and your arms at your sides. Place the right hand on the back of the head like you would for a crunch. Begin moving your torso down toward the left, crunching the left oblique, so that your right elbow reaches up toward the sky. Reach your left hand down toward the ground. Hold this position, squeezing the abs, then switch sides.|
NAME: Toe reach -- DESCRIPTION: Lying down on your back, reach your legs straight up so your feet are reaching toward the ceiling. For a modification, you can slightly bend your knees. As you exhale, tighten your upper abs and curl your head, neck and chest off the ground as you reach your arms toward your toes.|
NAME: Bicycle crunch -- DESCRIPTION: Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground as wide as your hips. With your hands behind your head and your elbows bent out to the sides, use your abs to lift your left shoulder blade off the ground. At the same time, bring your right knee to meet your left elbow. When your right knee is bent, straighten your left leg and reach it out in front of you at a 45-degree angle. Perform on the opposite side, bringing your left knee to your right elbow, straightening the right leg. Continue alternating legs and squeeze your core. Brush your inner thighs together as you switch sides to ensure youâ€™re hugging your legs in towards the midline of your body.|
NAME: Crunch -- DESCRIPTION: Lie on your back on a mat, knees bent, feet on the floor, and arms crossed over your chest. Ensure your neck stays untucked throughout the movement. Using your abs, begin to roll your head, neck, and shoulder blades up off the ground. Pause when you reach the top, then slowly lower back down.|
