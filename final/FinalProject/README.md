# Daily Workout Routine Program

## Description
Welcome to my project! This is a daily workout routine program made in C# using programming with class principles. The program chooses the workout according to the weekday. It helps the user to follow a
daily workout routine. The program stores the exercise lists in many text files. The exercise lists and classes are separated by muscle group and training goal. The Exercises class is the main class. The Menu class is responsible for displaying menu options for each program function. Inside each derived Exercises class, there is a workout routine.
