NAME: Push-up -- DESCRIPTION: To do a push-up you are going to get on the floor on all fours, positioning your hands slightly wider than your shoulders. Don't lock out the elbows; keep them slightly bent. Extend your legs back so you are balanced on your hands and toes, your feet hip-width apart. Inhale as you slowly bend your elbows and lower yourself to the floor, until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle. Exhale while contracting your chest muscles and pushing back up through your hands, returning to the start position.|
NAME: The Mountain Climber -- DESCRIPTION: Mimicking the movement of real-life climbers, set up in a high plank (pushup) position, straighten your back and engage your core during the exercise. Keep your body balanced and avoid bouncing on your toes. Your shoulders should be directly over your wrists. Most importantly, start slow.|
NAME: The Burpee -- DESCRIPTION: Squat down with your hands on the ground inside your feet, kick back into a pushup position with your feet wide, and hit the deck. Jump feet back so they land just outside hands. Reach arms overhead and explosively jump into the air. Land and immediately lower back into a squat for the next rep.|
NAME: Incline Push-Up -- DESCRIPTION: You can also do incline push-ups to make this exercise a bit easier. Stand several feet away from the table or bench. Use the same push-up technique as above to lower yourself until the elbows are at 90 degrees, then raise back up. Keep your core engaged throughout the movement.|
NAME: Decline Push-Up -- DESCRIPTION: Decline push-ups are a more difficult push-up, performed with the feet raised up on a box or bench. You can adjust the box height to increase or decrease the resistance using just your body weight.|
