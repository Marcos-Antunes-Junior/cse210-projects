NAME: Basic Squat -- DESCRIPTION: Start with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly out, and your arms down at your side.

Ensure that your knees don’t fall inward and your back stays straight. When your thighs are parallel to the ground, stop and push up through your heels to return to start.|

NAME: The Burpee -- DESCRIPTION: Squat down with your hands on the ground inside your feet, kick back into a pushup position with your feet wide, and hit the deck.
